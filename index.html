    <h1>Hello, English 388</h1>
    <p>
        My name is Christina, and I was born in Puyallup, Washington. 
        I have two siblings, one older and one younger brother. 
        I am a student at the University of Washington in Seattle, and my intended major is general biology. 
        My hobbies are drawing, singing, writing, taking pictures, and sleeping. 
        I enjoy watching Korean dramas and animations when I am at home, and I enjoy exploring new places or hanging out with friends when I am outside. 
        I like to eat dim sum and drink bubble tea. I like to listen to Korean pop and Korean r&b. Sometimes Japanese pop.
