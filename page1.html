    <h1>Introduction To My Favorite Foods</h1>
    <p>
        The following are my <em>favorite</em> foods.
        Ever since I was a kid, my family liked to go out and eat. 
        I found that my favorite foods tended to be in dim sum restaurants. 
        So I always looked forward to them. 
        My parents also would cook some of the following from time to time!

    <h1>Introduction To My Favorite Bands</h1>
    <p>
        The following are my <strong>favorite</strong> bands.
        These are groups that I have been listening to often these days. 
        I love the variety of music that these groups provide. 
        They all have their own color, all with their own different sounds.
        Although I tend to listen to softer music, these groups are great to
        listen to when you want to get into a good mood.
