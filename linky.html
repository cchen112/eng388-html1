        <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa_(sea_otter)">Rosa the sea otter</a> was well-known for her interactions with 
        humans at the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Raised in the aquarium, 
        she was a surrogate mother of 15 otters. She is older than the 
        oldest male sea otter, Adaa, and gets her physical checkups 3 times a year.
        Her favorite food was shells and crabs which were delivered using a plastic ball.
        After some time, she retired and was released into the wild in 2019.
